Dear Sir / Madam,

Seeing your open vacancy "Data Scientist" got me excited. I hope this writing will convince you why I think I am the right candidate for the job.

I am currently employed by Monsterboard as a Manager Sales Operations. My team consist of four Reporting, BI & Sales Readiness Analysts. 

In this position I am responsible for a multidisciplinary team covering both reporting, analysis & Business Intelligence responsibilities as well as more supporting operational matters. 

When I was promoted to this position, one of the first tasks I took upon myself was to assess how each member of my team creates value to the business, the current skillset, their potential to excel and what, if any, holds them back from doing so.

What I found was that I was blessed with a truly talented team of analysts who have never been challenged into learning new skills and tools, thus holding them back delivering their maximal potential to the business and growth of the company.

Having no budgets allocated for training or new tools, I challenged myself and the team to come up with a moon-shot.

How I succeeded this moon-shot, found a new passion in statistics, R and relational databases  is something I would like to demonstrate and more importantly why I think I’m the right candidate for this role at Booking.com

After reviewing my own resume, I felt that my skill sets and experience as a Data Scientist didn't really reflect me. What better way to show your skills and expertise than to communicate this information through my 'go to tool of choice': 'R'. https://jvanheer.shinyapps.io/MyCV/ has been entirely built using R.

Kind Regards,
Jered van Heerde
